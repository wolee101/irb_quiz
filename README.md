**Description**

**Overview**

The goal of this project is to create an IRB (Institutional Review Board) quiz that would help researchers determine if they need to apply for IRB approval for their research studies. Sometimes, especially in social science, researchers are uncertain if their studies considered human subjects research and thus IRB protocol should be submitted to IRB for review to be reviewed. As an alternative to going through complicated written materials, this quiz was designed to ask 5 key questions to researchers and help them make a preliminary decision about protocole submission. Researchers get their score at the end of the quiz and given an option to contact the IRB via email for further inquiry.
